[Install Varnam](/download/linux)

After installing varnam, you will need to enable Varnam IBus Engine for easily start typing on any app system-wide.

#### Setting Up IBus

Most GNOME systems are well-integrated with IBus by default.

If you're not using GNOME, you will need to setup IBus. ArchLinux Wiki has good information on setting up IBus: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/IBus

IBus setup might be a bit tricky in KDE. It can be easily setup in ArchLinux by installing `ibus-input-support`.

#### Enabling Varnam IBus Engine

##### GNOME

* Go to `System Settings -> Region & Language`
* See the section `Input Sources`
* Click on **+** button
* Search for "Varnam"
* Choose your language to add

##### Others

* Go to IBus Settings -> Input Method tab.
* Click "Add" Button
* Choose your language and click "Add" button

That's it! You can now switch input method using mouse by clicking on the icon in system tray.

You can also choose a keyboard shortcut to easily switch input methods. The default key-combo is `Meta Key` (Windows Key) + `Space`
