### Installation

You will need to install GoVarnam library in your system for any app to use Varnam.

* Download a [recent GoVarnam version](https://github.com/varnamproject/govarnam/releases).
* Extract the zip file
* Open a terminal and go to the extracted folder by using this command :
```bash
cd Downloads/govarnam
```
* Now run this command to install GoVarnam :
```bash
sudo ./install.sh install
```
It will ask for your password, enter it.
* Installation is finished

To check if installation is successful, try this command :
```bash
varnamcli -s ml enthaanu
```
It should give malayalam output if installation is successful.

* To make Varnam give better suggestions, you will need to import some words. Download a `.vlf` (Varnam Learnings File) file from here [TODO LINK].
* Import it:
```bash
varnamcli -s ml -import file.vlf
```
