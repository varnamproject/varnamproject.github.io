## Input Method Engine

An input method (IME) is an operating system component or program that enables users to generate characters not natively available on their input devices by using sequences of characters (or mouse operations) that are natively available on their input devices. [More in Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input_method).

IMEs are mostly used to type non-English languages in computer using an English keyboard.
