To use Varnam on Android, you will need to install two apps:

- [Indic Keyboard](https://indic.app/)
- Varnam

The "Varnam" Android app is not available in Play Store at the moment, you can obtain it from [Varnam's communication groups](http://localhost:1313/about/).

Installing external APKs has its risks, install APKs from people you trust only :)
